# AtliQ-Grand-Data-Analysis-Project

# 📌 Project Overview

AtliQ Grand is a hospitality analytics project focused on analyzing hotel booking and revenue data to uncover key business insights related to occupancy trends, revenue performance, and customer booking behavior. The goal of this project is to support data-driven decision-making for improving pricing strategies, room utilization, and revenue optimization across hotel properties.

# 🎯 Business Problem

AtliQ Grand faces fluctuating occupancy rates and revenue performance across cities, room categories, hotel types, and booking platforms. Without clear visibility into demand patterns such as weekday vs weekend behavior and seasonal revenue trends, it becomes difficult to optimize pricing, inventory, and marketing strategies.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook


# 📊 Key Analysis Performed

* Calculated occupancy rates and compared weekday vs weekend performance
* Analyzed revenue realized per city, hotel type, room category, and booking platform
* Identified high-performing cities and revenue-driving channels
* Performed month-by-month revenue trend analysis to identify seasonality
* Cleaned and transformed data, including handling missing values

 # 📈 Key Insights

* Weekend occupancy is higher than weekday occupancy, indicating strong leisure demand
* A small number of cities contribute a major share of total revenue
* Certain booking platforms generate significantly higher revenue
* Revenue shows clear seasonal patterns across months
